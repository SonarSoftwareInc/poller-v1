#The number of times to fork fping. Generally not productive to set too high, and may cause significant jitter/packet loss due to flooding of NIC.

#The number of simultaneous SNMP pollers to instantiate. This will consume additional RAM, CPU, and system resources such as file descriptors.
SNMP_FORKS=250
#The timeout in seconds to wait for SNMP results. This can be a decimal. The higher this is, the more polling will be delayed with a lot of down devices.
SNMP_TIMEOUT=1
#The amount of times to retry an SNMP query. Decreasing this will result in false down states if the device exceeds the SNMP_TIMEOUT value temporarily. Increasing it will increase the amount of time an SNMP polling cycle takes.
SNMP_RETRIES=0
#The timeout in seconds to wait for ICMP results. This can be a decimal. The higher this is, the more polling will be delayed with a lot of down devices.
ICMP_TIMEOUT=2
#How frequently, in minutes, you want to scan equipment associated with network sites to determine which devices are connected to each other. Pulling all the necessary information here is fairly intensive, so this should not be too low on large networks. The minimum value is 5.
